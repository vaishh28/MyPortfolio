Once there was a boy named Mohit. He was 21 years old. who was lazy he didn't do any work just stayed at home watching tv and eating and laughing he was very lazy.One day his father told him that you have to work hard and earn money if you can't do that then I won't give you food.
From tomorrow you have to go out and work.When you hand me money, I will give you food.

.<br><br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another day came and Mohit didn't go anywhere and didn't do any work.
When it was time for father to return from office. 
His mother gave him money and said give this money to your father and tell him that you have earned this money.

Mohit did as his mother told him.
But Mohit's father threw that money in the fire. And Mohit started laughing.
Then it happened everyday. Mohit was given money daily by his mother, he gave it to his father and his father threw the money in the fire.
Mohit always smiles.
He didn't earn that money so he wasn't worth the money.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His mother was tired of the daily routine.But his mother was very strict she did not give him anything to eat and said go out and earn money or I will not give you anything to eat.Then he went out and started looking for work.He moved to a few places and then worked at one.He worked hard, he was very tired.Then he went home and told his mother that he had earned money and said now dad will be happy.
.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His father comes from office, then he gives money to father, then his father again throws the money in the fire.
Then he immediately went towards the bonfire and took out the money from the bonfire.His hand was burnt.
Then his father went to him and applied medicine to his hand.Then his father said why did you save  money from fire today.
You haven't done this before.
  Then he didn't say anything then his father said, I will explain to you because you earned money today by yourself. you worked hard
"People value things only when they know how much effort it takes to get them."You understand what I have been trying to convey to you for the past few days.He said yes I understand. Thank you Dad for teaching me the beautiful lesson of life. And sorry to hurt you.
ok dear!<br>
