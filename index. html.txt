         <h1>Time And Respect</h1>
         <p>
         One’s upon a time. I was sitting our grocery shop. That day my father test me how I behave with the customer and unfortunately I not    passed it with 100% because I behave with them good but I stop them for a while as I was busy in my work. That time my father told me always attended the customer first then do our work.
“Customer is like God”
